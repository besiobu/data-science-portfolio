* Linear regression

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Statsmodels

## Project description
I extracted data from my Polar watch and after cleaning the dataset I built linear regression model to predict how many kilocalories I will burn during a workout. I used variables from the original data and features that I engineered by my self. The results of the regression can be found in the `mdl_results.txt` file.

## Summary
* I downloaded data generated by my Polar watch that tracks heart rate and estimates burned `kilocalories` during workouts.

* The data came in the form of `.json` files which were read, transformed and cleaned with `pandas`. 

* The clean dataset contains `283` workouts over a nearly one year period. 

* A linear regression model was built using `statsmodels` to predict the total `kilocalorie` expenditure based on the `duration` of the session, the `99 quantile of heart rate`, the `activity` type and whether the workout is `indoors`.

* The model achieves an adjusted `R^2` of `0.912`.

* The multiple linear regression model outperforms a simple linear regression using only `duration` in terms of `R^2`.

* After further transforming the data, the `duration` of a workout and `kilocalorie`s burned have `0.90` correlation. 

* The estimated formula is: `calories = 6.61 * time + 4.04 * heart_rate - 7.34 * indoors - 62.39 * activity - 458.49`

* The `indoors` variable is not statistically significant.

* The residuals of the model passed the `Breusch-Pagan` variance test.
