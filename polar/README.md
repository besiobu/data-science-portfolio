* Linear regression

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Statsmodels

## Project description
I extracted data from my Polar watch and after cleaning the dataset I built linear regression model to predict how many kilocalories I will burn during a workout. I used variables from the original data and features that I engineered by my self. The results of the regression can be found in the `mdl_results.txt` file. For illustrations see the `img` folder.

## Summary
* I downloaded data generated by my Polar watch that tracks `heart rate` and estimates burned `kilocalories` during workouts.

* The data came in the form of `.json` files which were read, transformed and cleaned with `pandas`. 

* The clean dataset contains `283` workouts over a nearly one year period. 

* After further transforming the data, I find that the `duration` of a workout and `kilocalorie`s burned have a `0.92` correlation. 

* A linear regression model was built using `statsmodels` to predict the total `kilocalorie` expenditure.

* Variables in the model are the `duration` of the session, the `99 quantile of heart rate`, the `activity` type and whether the workout is `indoors`.

* The model achieves an adjusted uncentered `R^2` of `0.958`.

* The estimated formula is: `calories = 7.91 * time - 5.44 * log(heart_rate) - 121.90 * activity_type + 48.12 * indoors`.

* All of the variables are statistically significant.

* The model has a tendency to underpredict long workouts.

* The residuals fail statisticall tests for normality and homoskedasticity.
