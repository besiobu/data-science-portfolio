# covid 19

## Project goal
The objective is to visualize various aspects of the pandemic of 2020.

### Methods
* Data visualization
* Data wrangling

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## Project description
I plot `time series` for `continents` and `countries`, inspect the `mortality rate` and create visuals to view the `rate of the spread` in the early days of the pandemic.
Furthermore I combine data about cases with data from the `World Bank` to see if I can uncover any interesting insights. For the analysis see the `notebooks` folder.
In total there are `52` different plots of various granularities. See the `img` folder for the plots.

## Summary

* As of `2020-10-20` the global confirmed cases reached `40 000 000` cases.

* The `exponential growth` in countries with the most cases lasted approximately `30 days`.

* The countries with the most confirmed cases are `The United States of America` followed by `India` and `Brazil`.

* Cases in `Asia` are still following an exponential growth curve.

* The main contributor to the growth in `Asia` is `India`.

* A `second wave` of infections is appearing in some countries.

* Observe that the first peak is significantly lower than the current levels. For example `Italy` vs `United Kingdom`:
