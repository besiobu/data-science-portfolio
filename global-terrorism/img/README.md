Here you can checkout the visualizations I made when analysing the `Global Terrorism Database`.

#### Assumptions
Certain assumptions were made about the data.
* I only use data from `2007` to `2017`.
* I only consider attacks that are definitely terrorist attacks.
* For attacks with an unknown number of fatalities I assume no one died.
